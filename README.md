# WeeklyWorth

This is a *very* simple app that helps budget-minded people break down their income and expenses into weekly chunks. The premise of the app is to see your total expenses, income, and what percentage of income you're using. You can also tag expenses as Fixed or Variable. Ideally, you'd reduce fixed expenses as much as possible, hence why they're separated.

This is very much an alpha stage, and is available for pull requests if you'd like to add or change something.
